In this repository, we will provide the code and data to generate some of the results that we show in our work
on using SNAP gates to create Wigner negative states in a 3D cavity including a GKP state as well as a Cubic Phase state.

In the notebooks folder, you will find Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the following:
 - Optimizing SNAP gates: We use a simple gradient-descent approach to obtain the SNAP gate parameters which uses the JAX autodifferentiation library.
